Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction afterTransform(er, data) {\n  var ts = this._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) {\n    return this.emit('error', new Error('write callback called multiple times'));\n  }\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data != null) // single equals check for both `null` and `undefined`\n    this.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = this._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    this._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = {\n    afterTransform: afterTransform.bind(this),\n    needTransform: false,\n    transforming: false,\n    writecb: null,\n    writechunk: null,\n    writeencoding: null\n  };\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.on('prefinish', prefinish);\n}\n\nfunction prefinish() {\n  var _this = this;\n\n  if (typeof this._flush === 'function') {\n    this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(_this, er, data);\n    });\n  } else {\n    done(this, null, null);\n  }\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

Besonders wichtig war uns dabei der Gedanke, dass der Benutzer nicht extra eine native App auf seinem Smartphone installieren muss, da das mit einem zu großen Aufwand verbunden ist. Des Weiteren war ein wichtiger Punkt für uns, dass die Gemälde im Museum eine größere Gewichtung haben als das Handy des Benutzers, denn in einem Museum möchte man nicht mit seinem Smartphone beschäftigt sein, sondern man möchte sich auf die Bilder konzentrieren. Unsere Anwendung ist so konzipiert, dass man die Informationen über bestimmte Gemälde über seine Kopfhörer anhören kann und sein Handy dabei in der Hosentasche lassen kann. Natürlich kann man die Informationen aber auch visuell einsehen. Damit Sie sich ein besseres Bild davon machen können, folgt nun ein Szenario:</p>\r\n      <h2 id=\"szenario\" class=\"title-text jump-item\">Szenario</h2>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"hint-text\"\r\n      >Simon ist auf dem Weg zu einer Ausstellung über den Künstler Lucas Cranach.

Außerdem bekommt er noch ein kleines Gerät ausgehändigt, einen NFC-Tag, welchen er lediglich vor ein Gemälde halten muss um Informationen zu diesem auf sein Handy zu bekommen. Auf dem NFC-Tag befindet sich eine Nummer, die Simon auf der Website des Museums eingibt. Nun verbindet er sein Smartphon mit seinen neuen Kopfhörern und steckt es in seine Hosentasche.

Unsere Anwendung ist darauf ausgelegt, dass der Nutzer im Idealfall sein Smartphone in der Hosentasche lassen kann und sich die spezifischen Informationen zu einem Gemälde über Kopfhörer anhören kann, indem er lediglich den NFC-Tag vor einen Microcontroller hält. Der zweite Anwendungsfall wäre, dass der Nutzer sich lieber die Informationen durchlesen möchte. Für diesen Fall werden auf der Website nicht nur Audiodateien abgespielt, sondern die Informationen werden auch visuell dargestellt. Unsere Anwendung ist derzeit noch nicht responsive, wäre aber, sollten wir das Projekt über längeren Zeitraum verfolgen, eine Überlegung wert (eventuell hat der Nutzer ein iPad, oder eine Smartwatch, ...). Mockups und unseren Styleguide finden Sie hier:\r\n        <br />\r\n        <a\r\n          href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/FNNS1oMtWXAHqQP4qxJbVq/Cranach-erweiterte-Interaktion?node-id=0%3A1\"\r\n        >https://www.figma.com/file/FNNS1oMtWXAHqQP4qxJbVq/Cranach-erweiterte-Interaktion?node-id=0%3A1</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 class=\"entscheidungs-headline\">Idee NFC</h2>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"hint-text\"\r\n      >Unsere Idee ist, dass der Nutzer bei einem Museumsbesuch sein Handy in der Hosentasche lassen kann und mit diesem nur über Kopfhörer verbunden ist. Sobald der Nutzer nun ein externes Gerät oder einen Chip vor ein Gemälde hält, so öffnet sich im Internetbrowser eine Seite und eine Audiodatei beginnt zu spielen. Der Nutzer soll hierbei keine Anwendung extra installieren müssen, sondern lediglich die Website des Cranach Archivs aufrufen müssen.</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"sub-text\"\r\n      >Unsere Idee ist dieses Konzept mit NFC umzusetzen, bei der der Nutzer einen NFC-Tag vom Museum erhält und mit diesen vor ein Gemälde halten kann, an welchen Microcontroller mit NFC-Lesegeräten installiert sind.</p>\r\n      <h2\r\n        class=\"entscheidungs-headline\"\r\n      >MQTT als Protokoll zur Umsetzung des Publish-Subscribe Paradigmas</h2>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"hint-text\"\r\n      >Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) ist ein leichtgewichtiges offenes Nachrichtenprotokoll, welches Machine-to-Machine-Kommunikation ermöglicht. Es wurde entwickelt, um Nachrichten effizient zu transportieren und dabei ressourcensparend zu sein, weshalb es sich sehr gut für den IOT-Bereich eignet.</p>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"sub-text\"\r\n      >Wir haben uns für dieses Protokoll entschieden, da es für uns das geeignetste Protokoll zu sein scheint, um unseren Use Case zu erfüllen. In unserem System werden lediglich minimale Informationen ausgetauscht und das auch nur, wenn eine Veränderung eintritt (User hält NFC Tag an das Gemälde). Daher eignet sich zunächst einmal das Publish-Subscribe Paradigma für die Datenübertragung sehr gut. MQTT wurde extra für dieses Paradigma entwickelt und ermöglicht durch seine TLS-Erweiterung eine sichere Übertragung. Durch die lose Kopplung zwischen den Kommunikationspartnern kann eine schnelle Datenübertragung ermöglicht werden, auch zwischen mehreren Kommunikationspartnern.</p>\r\n      <h2 class=\"entscheidungs-headline\">howler.js als Javascript Framework für Audiomanipulation</h2>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"sub-text\"\r\n      >Wir haben uns innerhalb des Kurses \"Frontend-Development 1\" mit einem Javascript Framework names howler.js beschäftigt, mit welchem man Audiodateien abspielen und manipulieren kann.

Die Antwort lautet: Ja! Unser Ziel war es ein System zu entwickeln, welches den Museumsbesuchern die Möglichkeit gibt, die Gemälde des Museums zu betrachten und sich zusätzliche Informationen anzueignen ohne dafür jedes Mal auf das Handy schauen zu müssen. Die Besucher müssen dafür lediglich ihren Transponder vor ein Gemälde (NFC-Reader) halten, die an das Smartphone angeschlossenen Kopfhörer einsetzen und das Handy kann in der Tasche bleiben.\r\n        Zwar haben wir ursprünglich verschiedene Ansätze probiert (wie Sie im Entscheidungs-logbuch und im Zeitplan sehen können), sind jedoch der Ansicht die bestmögliche Umsetzung für diesen Use Case gefunden zu haben.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 id=\"problemebeiderentwicklung\" class=\"title-text jump-item\">Probleme bei der Entwicklung</h2>\r\n      <p class=\"hint-text\">\r\n        Eine große Herausforderung war die Aneignung von Vuejs.

Jedoch konnten wir dadurch unsere Kompetenzen in der Selbstaneignung von Wissen enorm verbessern.\r\n        Abgesehen davon, hatten wir Probleme bei der Einbindung des Microcontrollers in unser System, da dieses Themenfeld groß ist und wir uns auch hier viele Dinge selbst aneignen mussten. Außerdem haben wir viel Zeit verloren, da wir erst nach einiger Zeit feststellen mussten, dass unser NFC-Reader defekt war.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 id=\"projektarbeit\" class=\"title-text jump-item\">Projektarbeit</h2>\r\n      <p\r\n        class=\"hint-text\"\r\n      >Durch den intensiven Einsatz von Github in den vergangenen Monaten, konnten wir hervorragend kol­la­bo­ra­tiv arbeiten, ohne uns dafür extra verabreden zu müssen.
